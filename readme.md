#Project of a persona SaaS page.

The current project that we are working in class can be found in the "betaClase" branch, wich have errors and its on develop. The current master branch its the one that its working (as far as I know) and tested before pushing. In the process of changing branchs, one or more commits could been lost, that will explain some empty spaces in the documentation.

#Current Status:
Working on v0.1 (its almost done but not finished)
